# GR4J_analysis
Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the GR4J rainfall-runoff model. We use a Gaussian Process emulator to facilitate history matching of the four physical input parameters of the GR4J simulator to historical data for 671 catchments across Great Britain.

The three folders contain data and plots for the 14-day case study, the 10-year case study, and our analysis of 671 catchments across Great Britain. The plot files are titled with the gauge id for each catchment. 

Note that after producing plots, we repeated all sensitivity analyses for new objective functions. As a result, plots and results for the updated sensitivity analyses are provided separately. Please ignore the sensitivity data and plots in the main files.
